# OIBSIP_sales_prediction_task5
Sales Prediction using Machine Learning  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting sales based on advertising expenditure across various media such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The dataset is used to build predictive models using Linear Regression and Random Forest to estimate future sales performance.
# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across different media (TV, Radio, and Newspaper). The notebook explores the relationship between advertising spend and sales using machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset includes advertising spend on the following platforms:
- TV
- Radio
- Newspaper

The target variable is Sales.

## Project Overview

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values
   - Scaling numerical features
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

2. Modeling:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor

3. Evaluation:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Visualization of predicted vs. actual sales

4. Visualizations:
   - Scatter plots with trend lines showing the relationship between each advertising medium and sales.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1903vishal20/OIBSIP_sales_prediction_task5.git
